# What is Organizational Intelligence?

Traditional AI assistants are generic. They answer questions based on general knowledge, but they don't understand *your* organization—your projects, your team, your context.

Organizational Intelligence changes that.

## Beyond Generic AI

Most AI tools work like this:
1. You ask a question
2. The AI searches its training data
3. It gives you a generic answer

Organizational Intelligence works differently:
1. You ask a question
2. The AI understands your workspace context
3. It connects relevant projects, documents, and team knowledge
4. It gives you an answer that feels like it came from inside your team's collective brain

## How It Works

### Context Awareness
Loopwell's AI reads your entire workspace:
- Active projects and their status
- Recent documentation and decisions
- Team structure and responsibilities
- Historical context and patterns

### Intelligent Connections
It doesn't just retrieve information—it connects the dots:
- Links related projects automatically
- Surfaces relevant documentation
- Identifies dependencies and blockers
- Suggests next steps based on context

### Proactive Assistance
Instead of waiting for questions, it:
- Surfaces blockers before they become problems
- Suggests relevant documentation when starting new work
- Connects team members working on related tasks
- Highlights important updates you might have missed

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're starting a new feature. Instead of:
- Searching through Slack for context
- Digging through old project docs
- Asking teammates "what's the status of X?"

Loopwell's Organizational Intelligence:
- Shows you related projects automatically
- Surfaces relevant documentation
- Connects you with team members working on similar features
- Provides context-aware suggestions for next steps

## The Future

This is just the beginning. As Loopwell learns more about how teams work, Organizational Intelligence will become even more powerful—anticipating needs, preventing problems, and amplifying team effectiveness.
